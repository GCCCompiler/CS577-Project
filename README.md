# CS577-Project
Contribution:
Yue Zhao responsible for writing papers and collecting data sources，Chengcan Gao is 
responsible for running Visual Prompting via Image Inpainting code and  experimental results，
Weiye Gao  take the responsibility for presentation.
Important:
Because the output model and the dataset for trainning is too big, so we delete in figuares_dataset and output_dir , otherwise, it can't been upload to github.And the experiment result is to big, we only keep 100 photos for each downstream tasks, it kept in evaluate/result directory. If the program can run, it should have last.ckpt in this project, but it is so big, so we don't upload it.

The code we modified have been written detailedly in final report, so we needn't write in it again.
